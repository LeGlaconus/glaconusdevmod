# To-do list:
## "Easy" to implement
- [X] util_movewith (almost finished : needs more modes/performance changes)
  - Modes : TP to origin / relative tp / relactive tp that cares about angles (a func_rotating would make an entity spin around itself and not oscillate)
- [ ] studio_model (CStudioModel : is supposed to be used like CBeam or CSprite)
  - [ ] Make a hands glazing animation for when getting the suit
- [ ] trigger_look
- [ ] trigger_timer
- [ ] trigger_random
- [ ] weapon_flare
- [ ] filter_* entities for trigger_*
- [ ] env_soundscape
  - Soundscape blending
- [ ] Flashbang grunts can use
- [ ] item_keycard
  - Rename item_security
  - Make it so it appears on the HUD
  - LEVEL DESIGN NOTE : Keycard usage is lame : it shouldn't be used like in Doom/Quake and more like in that one mod I played where it's a cool bonus that encourages player exploration
- [ ] item_generic (don't know why I wrote that one, probably not that useful)
- [ ] ai_* entities
  - ai_sound (for adding sounds/smells the AI can react to)
  - ai_scriptedschedule (like in HL2, could make combat encounter much more interesting)
  - ai_lead? (think more about that)
- [ ] Patrolling system (not the shitty Quake one that barely works in HL)
  - Scripted animations, field of view, rally points, advanced communication/teamwork
- [ ] monster_worker/monster_construction(_)worker
  - Would be a friendly guy like Barney (make them share the same lines but with a different pitch)
  - Would be seen on high places, usually on metal trusses
- [ ] AI changes
  - [ ] Make barneys reload their guns
  - [ ] Make barneys check if they are firing at the player
  - [ ] Make grunts check twice if they're gonna blow themself up because they're really dumb sometimes
  - [ ] Make scientists stop dancing when being hit (make them punch the player like in the beytah ?)
  - [ ] Move h_ai.cpp code in CBaseMonster
- [ ] Killable sitting monsters
  - Make sitting monsters the same entity as their base form and use a flag instead ?
  - Sitting/Leaving chair animations (would be hella cool)
- [ ] Gun scientist (like that one in the Lambda complex ?)
  - Would be cool as "unique" character you have to wlak with
- [ ] Implement featureful SDK cool features
- [ ] monster_panthereye (?)
- [ ] Monster like the tentacles for a chapter based around it ? (tentacles that crawl through corridors maybe ?)
## Probably out of the scope of the project
- [ ] Particle system (a pretty basic one)
- [ ] Rewrite the beam system
  - Ropes ?
- [ ] Cooler func_vehicle
  - Is necessary for that one desert level idea I had
- [ ] Automatic DSP like in HL2
  - [ ] rename env_sound to env_dsp
  - [ ] trigger_dsp (because it's easier to work with bounding boxes)
- [ ] Make AI use the hint keyvalue of info_nodes (Hint System)
  - I don't need to make it necesserily like the HL2 one, I could make so monsters could pick up bounding boxes from a brush entity as a cover space
- [ ] Scripted sequence smooth movement
  - Make a scripted sequence interpolate through path_tracks/corners (or its own entity) to have an uninterrupted smooth movement
  - Smooth animation blend ? (I think Valve tried to do that but didn't had the time to finish it)
- [ ] Sequence files (like in CS:CZ, but better ***cool glasses emoji***)
- [ ] Replace the renderer with the Trinity one
  - Add a fullbright texture system
  - Software water
  - 3d skyboxes made easy
  - Will use "modern" rendering techniques so wpolys can be higher than ever
  - Custom render modes (smth like the wireframe visual effect in SE would be nice for holograms)
  - Remember to remove the fast inverse square root function because we are in 2024
- [ ] ImGui implementation
  - Custom main menu (I hope it's possible)
- [ ] Custom version of SDHLT compilers
